I am a computational scientist and applied mathematician based in Ottawa, Canada. I'm currently affiliated with the <a href="https://www.mi.uni-koeln.de/NumSim/">Numerical Simulation</a> research group at the University of Cologne as well as a member of the <a href="https://github.com/trixi-framework/Trixi.jl">Trixi.jl</a> development team. I completed my PhD in 2024 at the University of Toronto under the supervision of <a href="http://goldfinger.utias.utoronto.ca/dwz/">David W. Zingg</a>. My research interests are in the development and analysis of structure-preserving numerical methods for partial differential equations and their application to scientific and engineering problems, particularly in the context of numerical weather prediction and climate modelling. If these topics interest you, feel free to follow me on <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Tristan-Montoya/">ResearchGate</a>, <a href="https://github.com/tristanmontoya/">Github</a>, or  <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=1nEXVtwAAAAJ&view_op=list_works&sortby=pubdate">Google Scholar</a> for updates on my research and open-source software contributions.
