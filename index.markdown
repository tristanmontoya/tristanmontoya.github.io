I am a computational scientist and applied mathematician based in Ottawa, Canada. I'm a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Saskatchewan, founder of <a href ="https://github.com/nonlinearnumerics">Nonlinear Numerics Inc.</a>, and a member of the <a href="https://github.com/trixi-framework/Trixi.jl">Trixi.jl</a> development team. I completed my PhD in 2024 at the University of Toronto under the supervision of <a href="http://goldfinger.utias.utoronto.ca/dwz/">David W. Zingg</a>, and subsequently worked as a postdoc at the University of Cologne. My research interests include the development and analysis of structure-preserving numerical methods for partial differential equations (PDEs) as well as the efficient and scalable implementation of PDE-based simulations for applications in science and engineering. If these topics interest you, feel free to follow me on <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Tristan-Montoya/">ResearchGate</a>, <a href="https://github.com/tristanmontoya/">Github</a>, or  <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=1nEXVtwAAAAJ&view_op=list_works&sortby=pubdate">Google Scholar</a> for updates on my research and open-source software contributions.
