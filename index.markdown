I am a PhD candidate at the University of Toronto Institute for Aerospace Studies (UTIAS) under the supervision of <a href="http://goldfinger.utias.utoronto.ca/dwz/">David W. Zingg</a>, with an expected completion date in early 2024. My primary academic interest is in the development and analysis of numerical methods for partial differential equations with applications in engineering and the physical sciences, with a particular focus on efficient, provably stable spectral-element methods for computational fluid dynamics on general unstructured grids.
