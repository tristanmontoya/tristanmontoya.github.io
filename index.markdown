I am a PhD candidate at the University of Toronto Institute for Aerospace Studies under the supervision of <a href="http://goldfinger.utias.utoronto.ca/dwz/">David W. Zingg</a> and currently a visiting researcher at the National University of Singapore, working with <a href="https://cde.nus.edu.sg/me/staff/gianmarco-mengaldo/">Gianmarco Mengaldo</a>. My academic interests are in the development and analysis of numerical methods for partial differential equations with applications in engineering and the physical sciences.
