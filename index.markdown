I am a computational scientist and applied mathematician currently working as a postdoctoral researcher in the <a href="https://www.mi.uni-koeln.de/NumSim/">Numerical Simulation</a> research group led by <a href="https://www.mi.uni-koeln.de/NumSim/gregor-gassner/">Gregor Gassner</a> at the University of Cologne. I completed my PhD at the <a href="https://www.utias.utoronto.ca/">University of Toronto Institute for Aerospace Studies</a> under the supervision of <a href="http://goldfinger.utias.utoronto.ca/dwz/">David W. Zingg</a>. My research interests are in the development and analysis of numerical methods for partial differential equations and their application to numerical weather prediction and climate modelling. If these topics interest you, feel free to follow me on <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Tristan-Montoya/">ResearchGate</a>, <a href="https://github.com/tristanmontoya/">Github</a>, or  <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=1nEXVtwAAAAJ&view_op=list_works&sortby=pubdate">Google Scholar</a> for updates on my research and open-source software contributions.
