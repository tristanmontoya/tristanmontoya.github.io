I am a PhD candidate at the University of Toronto Institute for Aerospace Studies (UTIAS) under the supervision of <a href="http://goldfinger.utias.utoronto.ca/dwz/">David W. Zingg</a>, with an expected completion date in early 2024. My primary academic interest is in the development and analysis of numerical methods for partial differential equations with applications in engineering and the physical sciences, with a particular focus on efficient and robust high-order methods for computational fluid dynamics. I am also interested in the interplay between numerical analysis and dynamical systems theory, specifically regarding the application of data-driven dynamical models to the analysis, acceleration, and control of numerical methods. My CV is <a href="/docs/TMontoya_CV_20230131.pdf">available for download here</a>.
