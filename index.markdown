I am a PhD candidate at the University of Toronto Institute for Aerospace Studies under the supervision of <a href="http://goldfinger.utias.utoronto.ca/dwz/">David W. Zingg</a>, currently working with <a href="https://cde.nus.edu.sg/me/staff/gianmarco-mengaldo/">Gianmarco Mengaldo</a> as a visiting researcher at the National University of Singapore. 

My primary academic interest is in the development and analysis of numerical methods for partial differential equations with applications in engineering and the physical sciences, with a particular focus on efficient and robust high-order methods for computational fluid dynamics. I am also interested in the interplay between numerical analysis and dynamical systems theory, specifically regarding the development of data-driven methods for the analysis and adaptive control of numerical discretizations.
