I am a PhD candidate at the <b>University of Toronto</b> under the supervision of <a href="http://goldfinger.utias.utoronto.ca/dwz/">David W. Zingg</a>, currently working with <a href="https://cde.nus.edu.sg/me/staff/gianmarco-mengaldo/">Gianmarco Mengaldo</a> as a visiting researcher at the <b>National University of Singapore</b>. 

My primary academic interest is in the development and analysis of <b>numerical methods</b> for <b>partial differential equations</b> with applications in engineering and the physical sciences, with a particular focus on efficient and robust high-order methods for <b>computational fluid dynamics</b>. I am also interested in the interplay between numerical analysis and <b>dynamical systems theory</b>, specifically regarding the development of <b>data-driven methods</b> for the analysis and adaptive control of numerical discretizations.
