I am a final-year PhD candidate at the University of Toronto Institute for Aerospace Studies (UTIAS) under the supervision of <a href="http://goldfinger.utias.utoronto.ca/dwz/">David W. Zingg</a>. My primary academic interest is in the development and analysis of numerical methods for partial differential equations with applications in engineering and the physical sciences. Specifically, I work on high-order methods for conservation laws, and I am particularly interested in their application to numerical weather prediction and climate modeling. If these topics interest you, feel free to follow me on <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Tristan-Montoya/">ResearchGate</a>, <a href="https://github.com/tristanmontoya/">Github</a>, or  <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=1nEXVtwAAAAJ&view_op=list_works&sortby=pubdate">Google Scholar</a> for updates on my research and open-source software contributions.
